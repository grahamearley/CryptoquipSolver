# MCMC Decryptor

An implementation of the decryption method described by Persi Diaconis in his paper [The Markov Chain Monte Carlo Revolution](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/MCMCRev.pdf) and used as an example in Bob Dobrow's *Introduction to Stochastic Processes with R*.

Using MCMC, the program decrypts simply encoded messages by getting closer and closer to the correct decryption function with each iteration.

#### To do:
- Analyze calibration text source and input text for decryption to approximate rate of convergence to the algorithm's convergence.
